# MDS

This allows bikeshare operator wants to be able to view current and historic station data from bike share systems from across the world.

This project is based on MDS data [here](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/)

## Technologies Used

- Flask
- React
- Docker

## Instruction

- Make sure you have docker installed on your machine
- Execute `docker-compose up` in the CMD to run the project.

## Implementation plan

Having an up to date data of all bike sharing systems around the world is important and below are my thoughts on how to make that happen.

- Create systems that collate up to date data from bike sharing systems.
- Make sure the bike sharing data covers more parts of the world.
- Incentives the bike sharing system operators that produces the most recent and up to date data.

Thank you very much.
